## ICS 161 Game 1 [Rework]
The original game was created 2 years ago for a Unity class I took. I was unfamiliar with Unity back then and produced a game that was rather messy. When revisiting old repositories, I thought it would be fun to revamp my old works and better them rather than leave it in a pile of its own misery.

## Assets
I kept all the assets the same and added nothing new. I also wanted to link/credit the creator but I could not locate this asset on the Unity Asset Store nor on YouTube where I recall watching their tutorial video. If I so chance upon it again, I will edit this.

## Using Tilemap
In the original game, I created my walls with multiple platforms stacked on top of each other.
